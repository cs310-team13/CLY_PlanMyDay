1. Emulator device and API version you have been using to run your app
- To run the app, launch Android Studio, use `Pixel 2 API 29`, and click on the `Run app` button which is a green triangle.
- Please make sure that you `sync the gradle` before running the application and try your best to follow the console instructions when the project fails to build.

2. User account credentials (username/password) that you have already created, through which we can log in
  - email: yeqilin@usc.edu, password: 111111

3. Any specific problems you believe that we might face due to certain API restrictions (e.g. Firebase, Google Maps)
  - if you are using a USC guest wireless connection, there is a possibility that Firebase will fail to authenticate for user registration or login. Please switch networks when `login failed` issues are encountered. Try switching to USC secure wireless or your hotspot if the application is accessed at USC.
